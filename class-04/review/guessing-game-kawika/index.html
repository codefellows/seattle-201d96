                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Kawika Miller and I'm a digital artist and aspiring web developer. When it comes to art I tend to side more on the illustration side of things but I also know how to 3D model and sculpt. When I'm feeling frustrated with tough artistic concepts I like to unwind with abstract painting which allows me to be more loose and not have to focus on things like anatomy or lighting. I typically use Adobe Photoshop for illustrations, Verve Painter for my abstract stuff, and Autodesk Maya &/o ZBrush for anything 3D related. I also have a background in game development although I have never worked in the game dev industry. I know some basic game dev workflows and have experience making prototypes with Unreal Engine and their blueprinting system. I have an unhealthy fixation on spicy foods and almost always go for the spiciest option available at Thai &/o Indian restaruants. Whenever I have time to game I usually bounce between Deep Rock Galactic, Final Fantasy 14, Escape from Tarkov, Destiny 2, and Old School Runescape, and every now and then I'll sprinkle in some Valheim or Stardew Valley. My music interests are all over the place and if you let my Spotify Liked Songs play on shuffle you're going to get whiplash. You might get Outkast. You might get Spice Girls. You might get System of a Down. You might get Louis Cole. If it's got a sweet bassline or some saxophone in it, I'm all about it. I'm also a huge animal person and I'm probably chillin' with the dog or cat if I'm ever at a party. I also have a Shiba Inu which is basically a cat in a dog's body. Horses are also pretty freakin' sweet and so are elephants, raccons, ferrets and capybaras. I think I've rambled on for long enough, you get the idea.</p>

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>The main thing I want to achieve is to learn and understand the more intricate parts of front-end web development. So getting a firm grasp on JavaScript to make cool animations & transformations and also learning React and understanding state and props better are definitely up there on my list of priorities. But I also want to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grow my professional network</li>
                        <li>Get better at whiteboarding and abstraction</li>
                        <li>Learn more back-end stuff so that I can better communicate ideas with other devs</li>
                        <li>Learn more about standards types of algorithms, such as what they do and how to know when to use them</li>
