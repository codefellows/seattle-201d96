## Guessing Game

This is a guessing game which is meant to demonstrate my current understanding of everything we have learned in the past two days. This project includes basic HTML structure and CSS styling as well as some JavaScript. The user will be prompted with a few questions and the answers will then be stored in variables which are then checked using conditional statements and then the user will receive a different alert depending on what answer is given.

[String.charAt()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charAt) was used in my `normalizeAnswer` function. This function gets the first letter of a response string, which is expected to be "yes" or "no", and then capitalized that letter so that the conditional checks only need to check for "Y" or "N".

[My Own Css Notes](https://github.com/KMArtwork/CSS-Notes) I also referenced my own CSS notes that I've compiled from the courses I've taken on Codecademy to create the flexbox for my `Education`, `Job Experience`, and `Goals` sections of the web page.

### Reflections and Comments
It was nice doing a refresher for some of the things I've learned in the past but haven't necessarily had much pratice with recently. Reminding myself how to nest lists inside of other lists and create a flexbox felt good. I'm definitely excited to start building more and more complex things as the days move forward and grow my confidence in web development.

Even though it was for a brief moment, I had to think about how I wanted to accomplish normalizing the responses to each question so that I could try to make my code as modular as possible. The function I created was pretty simple but it did its job perfectly.
